    "description": "The ports of New York City were critical to its early success and later prominence as an international center of trade. After the Civil War, however, the Hudson River became the favored site of major ports, and the South Street Seaport fell into decline. Now, as a museum, the Seaport is the largest privately owned collection of historic vessels in tonnage in the United States.",

It was renovated to be made exclusively of limestone in 1954. ",

    "description": "Back when New York was still New Amsterdam, an artillery battery was stationed along the southern tip of what is now Manhattan, to protect the settlement from any potentially hostile seaward approaches to the town. The site retained this function through the Revolutionary War, and the last remaining evidence of this is Castle Clinton. The outer walls of Castle Clinton were declared a National Monument in 1946 after they were nearly completely demolished in 1941 by Robert Moses to link Manhattan and Brooklyn.",
